If you changed your Oracle password, update in both places:

**1. In setup.bat:**
```batch
set DB_USER=system
set DB_PASSWORD=your_actual_password
set DB_DSN=localhost:1521/XE
```

**2. Create .env file:**
```
DB_USER=system
DB_PASSWORD=your_actual_password
DB_DSN=localhost:1521/XE
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-change-this
```

## Verify Everything Works

After logging in as admin:
1. Go to Users page
2. Look at audit_log entries
3. All your logins should be logged

Run this query to verify:
```sql
SELECT username, action, TO_CHAR(action_time, 'HH24:MI:SS')
FROM audit_log
ORDER BY log_id DESC
FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY;
```
